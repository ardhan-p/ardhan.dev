## ardhan.dev

This is my current personal website. You can visit on [ardhan.dev](https://ardhan.dev).

It's rather simple and frankly unoptimised (lol), but I think it gets the message across.

I have plans to improve the design and other aspects, but I'll have to think about it later.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the webpage.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
