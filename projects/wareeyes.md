My final year project for university involved creating a web application that monitors an inventory system in real-time. To achieve this, we had to utilise Apache Kafka to leverage its ability to produce and consume a large amount of data reliably and concurrently. To visualise this data, we used ReactJS for our frontend framework. Spring Boot was used for our backend, which can handle with the data from Kafka seamlessly.
